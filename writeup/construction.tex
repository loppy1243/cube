Let the cube \Cube\ be represented by its eight vertices $\vv y_1, \vv y_2, \dotsc, \vv y_8 \in
\R^3$ where
\begin{align*}
\vv y_1 &= (\s1, \s1, \s1),\quad \vv y_2 = (\s1, -1, \s1),\quad \vv y_3 = (-1, -1, \s1),\quad
  \vv y_4 = (-1, \s1, \s1),\quad \\
\vv y_5 &= (-1, \s1, -1),\quad \vv y_6 = (-1, -1, -1),\quad \vv y_7 = (\s1, -1, -1),\quad
  \vv y_8 = (\s1, \s1, -1). \numberthis\label{eqn:verts}
\end{align*}
We can easily determine the order $|\IsomC|$, since it must preserve which vertices neighbor
which. First, choose one of the eight vertices. Then, there are exactly three other vertices
that it must be connected to, which we may choose from and place beside it. Finally, there are
two vertices that may be placed beside this, since it is already beside the originally chosen
vertex. The number of isometries must then be
\[ |\IsomC| = 8\cdot3\cdot2 = 48. \]

Each face of \Cube\ may be represented by a standard basis vector or its negative
\[
\pm\unitv x_1 = (\pm1, 0, 0),\quad \pm\unitv x_2 = (0, \pm1, 0),\quad
\pm\unitv x_3 = (0, 0, \pm1).
\]
In particular, it will be useful in Section~\ref{sec:adj->R3} to know that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:vert-to-face}
\unitv x_1 = \frac14(\vv y_1+\vv y_2+\vv y_7+\vv y_8),\quad
\unitv x_2 = \frac14(\vv y_1+\vv y_4+\vv y_5+\vv y_8),\quad
\unitv x_3 = \frac14(\vv y_1+\vv y_2+\vv y_3+\vv y_4).
\end{equation}
Any $M \in \IsomC$ must map faces to faces, and so must map $\pm\unitv x_j \mapsto \pm\unitv
x_k$ for some $j, k = 1, 2, 3$. $M$ is also invertible since $\vv v \mapsto M\vv v$ is
one-to-one by definition of \IsomC, and so its' columns must be linearly independent. This
forces the columns of $M$ to take the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:isommat}
M = (\pm\unitv x_a, \pm\unitv x_b, \pm\unitv x_c)
\end{equation}
where $(a, b, c)$ is a permutation of $(1, 2, 3)$. There are $3!$ permutations and $2^3$
choices of sign, making
\[ 3!\cdot2^3 = 48 \]
such matrices, so this necessarily characterizes all $M \in \IsomC$.
