This paper is divided into two parts.

Part~\ref{part:construction} is a short, sweet, and direct construction of all isometries
\IsomC\ of the cube as signed permuation matrices over $\R^3$.

Part~\ref{part:generators} shows that all of \IsomC\ can be generated from a rotation (leaving
no vertex fixed), a reflection, and a ``spin'', or a rotation about an axis passing through
two vertices on opposite corners (leaving them fixed).

Part~\ref{part:adjrep} describes the representation of \IsomC\ over the adjacency matrix of
the cube, and gives an isomorphism between this representation and the $\R^3$ representation.
Following this, \emph{tilings} of isometries in the adjacency representation are constructed
that offer a somewhat interesting visualization. Two classes of examples of these tilings are
provided in the Appendix.
